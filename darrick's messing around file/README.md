this is specifically only for Darrick to mess around with code to see what works, this wont be in the final assignemtn

this is in the git because i need a source control

please read server sockets first then client sockets

how to run:
- use 2 terminals
- dont forget to cd into the file cd darrick*

terminal 1 (server, will recieve messages):
gcc server_sockets_play.c -o server
./server

terminal 2 (client, will send messages):
gcc client_sockets_play.c -o client
./client

PLEASE RUN SERVER FIRST THEN RUN CLIENT
